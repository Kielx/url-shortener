## Overview

The project was a challenge from [URL Shortener on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/url-shortening-api-landing-page-2ce3ob-G).
It was a good challenge to solidify my external API usage, responsive layout, and React skills.

### The challenge


The challenge was to integrate with the shrtcode API to create shortened URLs and display them like in the designs.
User stories that needed to be fulfilled:

    -View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
    -Shorten any valid URL
    -See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
    -Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
    -Receive an error message when the form is submitted if The input field is empty
